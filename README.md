A library management system is an infrastructure developed using c that allows users to search books and book content, add/remove selected books. It gives us complete details on the different books present in the library. It mainly focuses on basic operations like:

● Adding new books

● Viewing the books in the library

● Searching books

● Deleting books’ records

● Changing the books’ credentials

It operates with a login system, which allows a rather safe method of saving all the details.
The objective of this project is to develop a system in which a user can supply books to the application and organize books. It provides the ability to submit a new book to the database.
The “edit books’ credential” feature will allow the user to edit the book details and contents of a specific book.
The “search” function will allow users to access desired books and content in the most efficient manner possible. This tool also allows the user to delete book details from the database using the “delete” function.
